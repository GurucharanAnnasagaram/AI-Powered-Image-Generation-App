Project Overview
ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To build a Streamlit-based AI Image Generator that enables users to convert text prompts into images using DALLÂ·E and Stable Diffusion.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
âœ… Dual AI Model Selection â€“ Users can choose between DALLÂ·E (OpenAI) and Stable Diffusion (Hugging Face Diffusers).
âœ… Text-to-Image Generation â€“ Converts user-provided text prompts into AI-generated images.
âœ… User-Friendly UI â€“ Built with Streamlit, offering a simple and intuitive interface.
âœ… CUDA Acceleration â€“ Uses GPU for faster image generation with Stable Diffusion.
âœ… Expandable Design â€“ Can integrate new AI models in the future.

Technology Stack
Streamlit â€“ For interactive UI.
OpenAI API (DALLÂ·E) â€“ Generates images from text prompts.
Hugging Face Diffusers (Stable Diffusion) â€“ AI-powered image synthesis.
Torch (PyTorch) â€“ For efficient GPU-based processing.
dotenv â€“ Securely loads API keys.
How It Works
ðŸ”¹ User selects AI model â€“ Chooses between DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion.
ðŸ”¹ Enter a text prompt â€“ Users provide a description of the image they want to generate.
ðŸ”¹ AI Model processes the input â€“

DALLÂ·E calls OpenAIâ€™s API to generate an image.
Stable Diffusion runs a deep learning pipeline on GPU to create an image.
ðŸ”¹ Generated Image is displayed â€“ The app presents the AI-created image with a caption.
Use Cases
âœ… Art & Design Inspiration â€“ AI-generated images for creative projects.
âœ… Marketing & Advertising â€“ Quick visual content generation for campaigns.
âœ… AI Research & Development â€“ Experiment with text-to-image AI models.
âœ… Content Creation â€“ Create unique visuals for blogs, social media, or videos.
